KISS
The “keep it simple, stupid” principle applies to pretty much all of life, but it’s especially necessary in medium-to-large programming projects.

It starts way in the beginning when you’re defining the scope of what you want to create. Just because you’re passionate about game development doesn’t mean you can create the next World of Warcraft or Grand Theft Auto. When you think you’ve simplified enough, simplify it one level further — feature creep is inevitable, so start small.
